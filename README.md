1. Endpoints, Attributes, and their Associations to different Products and the UI
    - demonstrated using has many through associations.
    - Proof of concept using actionlog, this works and is scalable for the rest of the endpoints and associated attrs. 
    - test and test2 would represent products such as Roster or Engage. 
    - Also implemented some very basic front end using Flex principles and some stockish images.
